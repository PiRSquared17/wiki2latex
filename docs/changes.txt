* Removed ((WikiContent)) in LaTeX-Templates. Replace it with: ((W2L_CONTENT))
* Removed support for old config-arrays $w2l_config and others. This only affects very old installations. Change them in your config files as such:
** $w2l_config     to $w2lConfig;
** $w2l_tags       to $w2lTags;
** $w2l_pFunctions to $w2lParserFunctions;
* Added German Translation
* Removed reference-support from w2lDefaultSettings.php. Reactivate it by adding include('contrib/ref.php'); to your own w2lConfig.php
